## How to work

- This directory is a copy of FoaMES, an ERP-agnostic manufacturing execution system on the Frappe framework. Read `AGENTS.md` first: it lists the invariants every change must keep.
- No Frappe site is available. The modules this task touches are pure Python. Run tests like this from the repository root:

  ```
  PYTHONPATH=.foames-bench/stubs:. python -m unittest foames.foames_mes.test_machine_data_logic
  ```

  `.foames-bench/stubs` holds a stand-in `frappe` package that only lets imports succeed; do not change it.
- Add or update unit tests for what you change, next to the module, in a `test_*.py` file.
- Keep the change to what the task needs. Do not reformat unrelated code.
- When you finish, write `BENCH_NOTES.md` in the repository root: what you changed, what you assumed, and anything the data or the request cannot tell you. A few short paragraphs are enough.
- Work without asking questions; nobody will answer. Where the request is ambiguous, choose the reading that keeps the plant's numbers honest, and say so in `BENCH_NOTES.md`.
